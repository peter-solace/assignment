## Additional Notes
### Frontend

- Generic buttons and input fields have the potential to be abstracted into reusable components, improving maintainability and consistency across the application.
- Integrating [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) would simplify form management and enhance validation handling.

### Backend

- In the advocates' table, I implemented a dynamic column with an index to optimize query performance. This approach is more efficient than indexing each column individually.
- Using a tool like ElasticSearch could provide more accurate and scalable search results.
- Adding an extra caching layer could further boost performance and alleviate database load.

### AI Assistance

- I’ve leveraged AI tools for assistance in several areas
- Since it had been some time since I last worked with Tailwind CSS, I used ChatGPT to help generate utility classes efficiently (e.g., "Hey, make this form look great").
- I’m new to working with Drizzle, so I sought help to navigate its features effectively.
- This markdown itself and its improved readability are courtesy of some AI assistance.
